# valatro

this project, made in Lua with the LOVE 2D framework, is intended as a balatro-themed valentine's day gift.

the player clicks on the card icon in the bottom right corner to begin the card animation.

with each click, a sound effect is played.

after the card icon finishes moving, it changes to display what is intended to be the opposite side of the card.

once all 5 cards are displayed and read "HAPPY," an invisible object is set to move along the x-axis.

once thie object finishes moving, the cards change to read "VALENTINE'S."

this process is then repeated along the y-axis, and the cards change to read "DAY" with the card back in the 1st and 5th positions.
